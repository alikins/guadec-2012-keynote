History of Gnome - FIXME: this title sucks.

Abstract:

The first version of Gnome was first announced around August 1997.
Even before that, it already had a prehistory:  the GIMP was the first
free-as-in-freedom "end-user" application; it had been using its
home-grown GTK+ toolkit for a couple of years, and an enthusiastic
group of people had formed around the toolkit and the GIMP itself.
Come and listen to three veterans of Gnome - the old fogeys - talk
about our early history, our early successes and mistakes, and
hopefully look at pictures, screenshots, and other mementos of old
software which you now use in its ever-evolving form.
