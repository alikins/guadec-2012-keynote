History of Gnome - FIXME: this title sucks.

Abstract:

The first version of Gnome was first announced around August 1997.
Even before that, it already had a prehistory:  the GIMP was the first
free-as-in-freedom "end-user" application; it had been using its
home-grown GTK+ toolkit for a couple of years, and an enthusiastic
group of people had formed around the toolkit and the GIMP itself.
Come and listen to three veterans of Gnome - the old fogeys - talk
about our early history, our early successes and mistakes, and
hopefully look at pictures, screenshots, and other mementos of old
software which you now use in its ever-evolving form.


Ideas:

* Can we get GIMP 0.54 / 0.6x running?

* Can we get really old Gnomes running?

* Screenshots of Gnome's old webpages

** Get them from archive.org

* Screenshots of old Gnome versions

** See Owen's presentation

** Dig up Nat's "Swinging the pendulum"

* Photos of old Gnome swag:

** Put out a call for mementos from GUADEC Paris, LinuxWorld, etc.

* Eazel's "sorry, we are fucked" sign - eavel.com

** "Yes, The Andy Hertzfeld himself was involved in Gnome"

* Photos of Red Hat Labs' multiprocessor Xeon twisting video in real
  time?  "this was considered cutting-edge..."

* MC crashed as you opened a new folder.  But it would restart
  automatically showing all the previous windows and locations, so it
  "just flickered and showed you the right window".

* Bob Young would kill Gnome at Red Hat unless it was shown to work by
  $deadline.  Mad hacking night.

* GUADECs - need pictures, etc.
